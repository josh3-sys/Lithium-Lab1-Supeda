						<h1>Hollow Knight</h1>
						<p>The game takes place in a fallen kingdom plagued by a supernatural disease. It spans across diverse subterranean areas, featuring insect-like characters and bosses. Players can unlock different abilities and skills as they explore, as well as pieces of lore that contribute to the player's imagination of what the lost kingdom was like. The player sets their own path, unraveling mysteries and conquering its evils.</p>
